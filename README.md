# Mad Libs Word Game
# The World's Greatest Word game
What are madlibs? They are short, silly stories based on the words inputted by you.
Inspired by Summer Sonâ€™s Mad Libs project with Javascript. The program will first prompt the user for inputs out of the created categories. For example, I've created a noun, an adjective, etc. Then, onve the word has been inputted, the program will take that data and place them into a premade story line. 
Ready to get MAD!!
